## üîß How to Modify the Page

This project was designed to be easily customizable. Here‚Äôs how you can modify its key parts:

*   **Hero Text & Content:** All text content and the main page layout can be found in `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`.
*   **Header Navigation:** The header links and structure for both desktop and mobile are located in `src/components/Header.tsx`.
*   **3D Scenes:**
    *   The **3D Cursor** model and its animation logic are in `src/components/CursorScene.tsx`. You can change its colors and animation speed here.
    *   The **3D Grid Background** is in `src/components/GridBackground.tsx`. Its colors and position can be adjusted for both mobile and desktop.
*   **Animated Button:** The "Make your Dream Website" button is a dedicated component in `src/components/AnimatedBorderButton.tsx`. Its complex styling, including the gradient colors and "liquid glass" effect, is controlled in `src/components/styles/AnimatedBorderButton.css`.
*   **Styling & Theming:**
    *   Global styles, fonts, and the text selection color are in `src/index.css`.
    *   Responsive styles and media queries are located at the bottom of the CSS file for each respective component (e.g., `LandingPage.css`, `Header.css`).
